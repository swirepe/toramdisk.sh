## What is it?

It's a bash script for taking a folder and copying it into memory.

I use it to keep all of the stuff I want sourced for bashrc in memory, so that multiple terminals load up faster.  I wouldn't need this if I had a solid state drive.  

( See [my personal scripts](https://github.com/swirepe/personalscripts) for details. )
